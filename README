# Canvas Image Slider

This project is a customizable canvas-based image and video slider with audio and plugin support. It has been inspired by the work of [Dario Fuzinato](https://codepen.io/fuzinato/pen/PwLLjB).

## Demo
[View the demo](https://cinematic-slider.web.app/)

## Features

- Supports both images and videos
- Dynamic canvas rendering and responsive resizing
- Customizable audio controls
- Plugin-based effects for enhanced transitions
- Text overlays (headings and subtitles)

## Installation

You can run this project locally by either:

1. Simply opening the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
2. Setting up a local server such as `http-server`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server
   ```

   Then, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Usage

To customize the slider, modify the `mediaInfo` array in the `media.js` file with your own media URLs, headings, and subtitles. You can also enable or disable options such as auto-cycling, navigation arrows, and audio.

### Example Media Data Structure:

```javascript
const mediaInfo = [
  {
    src: 'path/to/image1.jpg',
    heading: 'First Slide',
    subtitle: 'This is the first slide.'
  },
  {
    src: 'path/to/video.mp4',
    heading: 'Second Slide',
    subtitle: 'This is a video slide.'
  }
];
```

## Plugin Extensions

The slider can be easily extended by writing custom JavaScript plugins or using existing libraries like GSAP. To include additional libraries, simply load them in the HTML file.

### Example Plugin Integration:

```javascript
import { SomeCustomPlugin } from './plugins/someCustomPlugin.js';
let plugin = [new SomeCustomPlugin()];
```
